TELUS has had long standing commitment to putting customers first, and part of putting customers first is protecting their privacy. In this age of information and constant connectivity, there is more data available than ever, and customers expect their data to be used responsibly and their personal information protected persistently. TELUS has a strong commitment to protecting the privacy of its customers and the responsible use of any data. 

At TELUS Digital we strive to improve the customer experience through the use of the Digital Platform. In our efforts to improve each and every customer’s experience, we utilize consumer data to provide insights into how we can help improve our platform and services to make customers’ lives easier. In the data that we use there is often sensitive information that can be personally identifiable. This sensitive information, although useful to our goal of improving customer experience, can pose a privacy risk if this sensitive information is connected to an individual.  One of the hurdles at TELUS Digital is how we can de-identify these datasets to protect privacy while still preserving its utility and referential integrity. 

This documentation outlines the different methods available to the creators at TELUS Digital to de-identify their data while maintaining a harmonious relationship between privacy and utility.
