# Accessibility 
Accessibility is about ensuring as many customers as possible can effectively use a product or service. This manner of thinking automatically lends itself to better strategy, design and overall key message.

## Overview

The [Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act](http://www.aoda.ca/) (AODA) and [Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission](http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/home-accueil.htm) (CRTC) mandates accessibility compliance. 

TELUS is committed to meeting or exceeding the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0, level AA (WCAG 2.0 AA)](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag). We expect our partners and vendors to do the same.
